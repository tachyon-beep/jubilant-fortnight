# Issue: Writing Guide Lacks Practical Examples and Narrative Craft Guidance

## Issue ID

`ISSUE-2025-01-21-001`

## Title

Narrative Writing Guide insufficient for content creators - missing examples, voice guidelines, and LLM integration details

## Status

- [ ] Open
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Under Review
- [x] Resolved
- [ ] Closed
- [ ] Won't Fix

## Priority

- [ ] Critical (Blocks gameplay/deployment)
- [x] High (Affects core features)
- [ ] Medium (Quality of life/enhancement)
- [ ] Low (Nice to have)

## Description

The current WRITING_GUIDE.md provides technical specifications for YAML structures and placeholder usage but lacks essential narrative craft guidance, concrete writing examples, and integration details needed for consistent, high-quality content creation.

## Current State

The writing guide contains:

- Basic style rules (perspective, length, rating)
- Placeholder glossary with 14 defined tokens
- YAML structure examples for 3 of 6+ narrative surfaces
- Generic safety checklist
- File-to-function mapping table

However, it lacks:

- Actual narrative examples (good vs bad)
- Scholar voice/personality guidelines
- Complete coverage of all narrative surfaces
- Tone pack structure and examples
- LLM prompt integration guidance
- Mechanical consequence writing patterns
- Testing validation procedures

## Desired State

A comprehensive writing guide that enables contributors to:

1. Write consistent, engaging narrative content matching the game's tone
2. Understand how to express scholar personalities through dialogue
3. Create narrative that hints at mechanical consequences
4. Test and validate their content contributions
5. Integrate with both template and LLM-enhanced systems
6. Follow clear examples for each narrative surface

## Impact Analysis

### Affected Components

- `/docs/WRITING_GUIDE.md`
- All YAML narrative files in `/great_work/data/`:
  - `sidecast_arcs.yaml`
  - `defection_epilogues.yaml`
  - `sideways_vignettes.yaml`
  - `recruitment_press.yaml`
  - `table_talk_press.yaml`
  - `mentorship_press.yaml` (currently undocumented)
  - `press_tone_packs.yaml` (referenced but not detailed)

### User Impact

- **Content creators** cannot confidently contribute narrative without extensive code diving
- **Narrative quality** varies due to lack of voice/tone examples
- **Testing gaps** arise from incorrect placeholder usage or untested narrative chains
- **LLM enhancement** underutilized due to missing prompt guidance

### Technical Impact

- Low technical complexity (documentation only)
- No code changes required
- Improves content contribution velocity
- Reduces review cycles for narrative PRs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add 3+ good/bad writing examples with explanations
- [ ] Document all 6+ narrative surface YAML structures
- [ ] Include scholar voice guidelines by archetype (Empiricist, Mystic, Postdoc, Visionary)
- [ ] Provide tone pack structure and rotation examples
- [ ] Add mechanical consequence hinting patterns
- [ ] Document LLM prompt integration and persona metadata
- [ ] Include actual test commands that work (`pytest -k narrative` doesn't exist)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

## Implementation Notes

1. Start by auditing all narrative surfaces in the codebase
2. Extract working examples from existing YAML files
3. Document undocumented surfaces (mentorship_press, theory templates, etc.)
4. Create side-by-side good/bad examples with explanations
5. Add section on testing narrative chains through the orders dispatcher
6. Include examples of successful LLM enhancement patterns
7. Consider adding a "quick start" section for new contributors

## Related Issues

- Future: Create narrative test suite for automated validation
- Future: Build narrative preview tool for testing without full game run
- Related: Gap Analysis mentions missing "automated tone/safety guardrails"

## Estimates

- **Effort:** Medium (2-8 hours)
- **Risk:** Low

## Resolution Notes

The Writing Guide has been comprehensively updated to address all identified gaps:

- Added Quick Start checklist for new contributors
- Documented all 6 narrative surfaces with YAML examples
- Added scholar voice guidelines by archetype
- Included good vs. bad writing comparisons with explanations
- Documented tone pack structure and rotation
- Added mechanical consequence hinting patterns
- Provided LLM integration details and persona metadata guidance
- Fixed test commands with actual working paths
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting section

The guide now serves as both a technical reference and a practical writing craft guide.
