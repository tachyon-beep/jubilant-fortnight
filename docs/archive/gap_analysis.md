# Gap Analysis: High-Level Design vs. Current Implementation

Last Updated: 2025-09-21 (Guardian moderation, seasonal telemetry)

## 1. Scholar Lifecycle and Memory

- **Design intent:** Maintain a roster of 20–30 memorable scholars blending handcrafted legends with procedurally generated additions, spawn sidecast scholars from expeditions, nurture mentorship-driven career growth, and track defections with scars and public fallout.【F:docs/HLD.md†L24-L177】
- **Implementation status:** `GameService` enforces the roster window, seeds new procedurally generated scholars, activates mentorships, progresses mentored careers, and resolves multi-stage defection negotiations with layered press. Multi-press orchestration now pulls from the sidecast arc catalogue, defection epilogues, recruitment/table-talk follow-ups, and sideways vignette payloads so sidecasts advance through debut/integration/spotlight beats while defections apply relationship adjustments alongside archived outcomes.【F:great_work/service.py†L89-L760】【F:great_work/service.py†L1024-L1995】【F:great_work/service.py†L4460-L4668】【F:great_work/multi_press.py†L350-L520】【F:great_work/multi_press.py†L900-L1120】【F:great_work/data/sidecast_arcs.yaml†L1-L90】【F:great_work/data/defection_epilogues.yaml†L1-L48】
- **Gap:** Mentorship activations/progression/completion now adjust scholar feelings and log history, sidecast phases persist sponsor ties, `/status` surfaces the summary, recruitment/defection flows pull in the modifier, and the new seasonal commitments and faction projects consume the same history. Fresh defaults (28-day pledges, relationship-weighted costs, seasonal debt reprisal knobs) and `/gw_admin create/update` controls give operators levers to tune the loops in real time. Telemetry now tracks seasonal commitment charges/overdue statuses and emits alerts before reprisal cascades; the remaining work is tuning the numbers with live data.【F:great_work/service.py†L3717-L4395】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L1597-L1637】【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L1356-L1504】【F:great_work/state.py†L2188-L2335】

## 2. Confidence Wagers, Reputation, and Recruitment Effects

- **Design intent:** Confidence wagers must follow the tuned reward/penalty table, clamp reputation within bounds, and impose recruitment cooldowns on high-stakes wagers while recruitment odds reflect cooldowns, faction influence, and unlock thresholds.【F:docs/HLD.md†L44-L138】
- **Implementation status:** Theory and expedition commands require explicit confidence levels; resolutions apply wager tables, clamp reputation, enforce cooldowns, and recruitment odds include influence bonuses plus cooldown penalties, all surfaced through `/status`, `/wager`, and the new `/recruit_odds` preview table.【F:great_work/service.py†L1009-L1110】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L317-L381】
- **Gap:** None – players can review comparative recruitment odds before committing via `/recruit_odds`.

## 3. Expedition Structure and Outcomes

- **Design intent:** Each expedition type should apply tailored costs, prep modifiers, and depth-aware failure tables that yield sideways discoveries with gameplay repercussions such as faction swings, gossip, or queued orders.【F:docs/HLD.md†L57-L138】
- **Implementation status:** Expedition launches deduct faction influence, persist preparation details, and an `ExpeditionResolver` rolls d100, applies modifiers, consults depth-specific failure tables, and now draws from a data-driven sideways catalogue to emit faction shifts, theories, queued orders, and tagged follow-ups that the orders dispatcher applies downstream.【F:great_work/service.py†L170-L392】【F:great_work/expeditions.py†L60-L213】【F:great_work/models.py†L122-L206】【F:great_work/data/sideways_effects.yaml†L1-L214】【F:great_work/service.py†L4734-L4999】
- **Gap:** Landmark prep now pulls from dedicated YAML templates and the resolver surfaces varied discovery copy; the remaining work is tuning tag-driven mechanics as telemetry reveals balance issues.【F:great_work/data/landmark_preparations.yaml†L1-L180】【F:great_work/expeditions.py†L160-L320】

### 3.1 Great Projects - Status

- **Design intent:** Full implementation of Great Projects as large science efforts that unlock new research domains.【F:docs/HLD.md†L61】
- **Implementation status:** Great Projects are selectable via Discord, carry bespoke costs and rewards, and resolve through the shared expedition pipeline.【F:great_work/service.py†L170-L214】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L141-L209】【F:great_work/data/settings.yaml†L18-L28】
- **Gap:** None – feature matches the high-level design.

## 4. Influence Economy and Faction Mechanics

- **Design intent:** Influence should operate as a five-dimensional economy with soft caps tied to reputation and faction requirements across key actions, supported by additional sinks such as symposium commitments and contracts.【F:docs/HLD.md†L90-L213】
- **Implementation status:** Influence is stored per faction and clamped to reputation-derived bounds. Core actions debit/credit faction balances (expeditions, recruitment, mentorship, conferences), digest ticks apply contract upkeep per‑scholar with debt/reprisal handling, and weekly symposium pledges create debts with reprimand follow‑ups for chronic non‑voters. Seasonal commitments and faction projects provide medium‑term sinks with admin create/update tooling, while long‑tail economy options (`/invest`, `/endow_archive`) allow players to move surplus influence into relationship boosts, debt relief, and archive programs. `/status` surfaces per‑faction balances, contract upkeep, seasonal commitments, and recent investments; telemetry tracks contract/seasonal charges, reprisals, queue depth, and economy summaries for dashboards and alerts.【F:great_work/service.py†L677-L1110】【F:great_work/service.py†L4337-L4460】【F:great_work/service.py†L4461-L4660】【F:great_work/service.py†L1561-L1668】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L1375-L1460】【F:great_work/state.py†L247-L283】【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L1080-L1240】
- **Gap:** Mechanically complete; remaining work is balance/tuning (contract upkeep values, seasonal commitment defaults, reprisal thresholds/cooldowns, relationship bonuses from investments) based on playtest telemetry. Consider adding per‑faction caps that scale with long‑term reputation and publishing a brief operator guide for recommended ranges.【F:great_work/data/settings.yaml†L30-L68】【F:docs/TELEMETRY_RUNBOOK.md†L1-L140】

## 5. Press Artefacts and Public Record

- **Design intent:** Every move should produce persona-driven press artefacts that persist in a public archive—bulletins, manifestos, discoveries, retractions, gossip, recruitment notes, defection wires—and stay publicly accessible.【F:docs/HLD.md†L86-L354】
- **Implementation status:** Core actions call structured template generators, archive releases in SQLite, and `/gazette`, `/export_log`, and `/export_web_archive` surface history. Expedition, defection, symposium, mentorship, recruitment, table-talk, sidecast, and admin flows now queue delayed follow-ups via `MultiPressGenerator`, with staggered fast/long cadences delivering gossip, faction briefings, commons roundups, mentorship bulletins, sidecast spotlights, defection epilogues, and administrative updates alongside the primary artefact; tone packs support rotating headlines/blurbs per setting, YAML libraries drive recruitment/table-talk/sidecast copy, deep-prep sideways vignettes now dispatch layered press, and digest ticks mint highlight blurbs from the scheduled press queue.【F:great_work/service.py†L170-L392】【F:great_work/service.py†L680-L744】【F:great_work/service.py†L1013-L1106】【F:great_work/service.py†L1996-L2470】【F:great_work/multi_press.py†L620-L960】【F:great_work/data/recruitment_press.yaml†L1-L48】【F:great_work/data/table_talk_press.yaml†L1-L24】【F:great_work/data/sidecast_arcs.yaml†L1-L60】【F:great_work/data/defection_epilogues.yaml†L1-L32】【F:great_work/data/sideways_vignettes.yaml†L1-L36】【F:great_work/press_tone.py†L1-L102】【F:great_work/state.py†L1-L520】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L562-L940】【F:great_work/web_archive.py†L416-L520】
- **Status:** The new YAML libraries and writing guide broaden coverage, and Guardian moderation now guards both player input and generated press; informational commands now broadcast to the configured channels and player status reports surface faction sentiment derived from mentorship and sidecast histories. Remaining work: add a validation workflow for tone packs so narrative updates can be vetted before deploy.【F:great_work/moderation.py†L1-L240】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L870-L1325】【F:great_work/service.py†L2429-L6850】
- **Status:** Player-facing commands (`/status`, `/symposium_backlog`, `/symposium_status`, `/gazette`) now emit embeds summarising mentorship history, symposium scoring, and recent headlines while digests track press mix diversity for telemetry. Newly added vignettes cover espionage/sabotage beats to widen tone coverage.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L1135-L1475】【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L130-L214】【F:great_work/data/sideways_vignettes.yaml†L1-L120】

### 5.1 Public archive availability

- **Design intent:** Keep a permanent, public, citable archive beyond Discord.【F:docs/HLD.md†L214-L354】
- **Implementation status:** `/export_web_archive` builds a static site with permalinks, search, and scholar profiles on disk, `/archive_link` retrieves specific headlines, each digest exports the archive automatically, syncs it into the container-served static host, and posts a timestamped ZIP snapshot to the admin channel with retention pruning.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L591-L737】【F:great_work/service.py†L1747-L1880】【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L180】【F:docs/internal/ARCHIVE_OPERATIONS.md†L1-L130】
- **Status:** GitHub Pages is now the chosen external host. The scheduler mirrors digest exports into the configured Pages repository, drops `.nojekyll`, and raises telemetry/admin alerts on failure while the nginx container continues to serve the local archive.【F:docs/HLD.md†L214-L354】【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L220】

## 6. Timing, Gazette Cadence, and Symposiums

- **Design intent:** Twice-daily Gazette digests should advance cooldowns, timeline years, and queued orders before publishing to Discord, while weekly symposiums run structured topics with mandatory responses.【F:docs/HLD.md†L101-L386】
- **Implementation status:** `GazetteScheduler` advances the digest, resolves follow-ups/mentorships/conferences, exports the archive, posts to configured channels, emits digest highlight blurbs drawn from the scheduled press queue, raises alerts on slow or thin digests, and sends "upcoming highlights" to an opt-in channel. Weekly symposia now auto-expire stale proposals, enforce per-player backlog caps, score pending topics for freshness/diversity, create pledge rows for every player, settle outstanding symposium debt before new pledges, trigger faction reprisals on sustained debt, and expose per-proposal scoring breakdowns (age decay, fresh bonus, repeat penalty) plus reprisal schedules via `/symposium_backlog` and `/symposium_status`, with telemetry mirroring the same detail for ops review.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L200】【F:great_work/service.py†L2094-L2700】【F:great_work/service.py†L3450-L3590】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L789-L1023】
- **Gap:** Heuristics still need calibration (age weights, bonus/penalty values) and configurable guardrails before release; use the new telemetry to tune thresholds, evaluate fairness for backlog saturation, and document recommended reprisal settings for different player counts.【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L788-L890】【F:docs/internal/PHASE3_POLISH_DESIGN.md†L1-L120】

- **Status:** Manual pause control now mirrors the resume flow. `/gw_admin pause_game` records the operator, archives an admin press release, emits multi-layer notifications, and logs telemetry so incidents and maintenance windows can be initiated proactively before using `/gw_admin resume_game` to restore play.【F:great_work/service.py†L5197-L5263】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L2223-L2255】【F:docs/TELEMETRY_RUNBOOK.md†L20-L112】

### 6.1 Non-expedition order batching

- **Design intent:** Orders like mentorships, conferences, and other delayed actions should share a generic batching framework handled at digest time.【F:docs/HLD.md†L101-L213】
- **Implementation status:** A shared `orders` table now feeds orders dispatcher helpers that activate mentorships, resolve conferences, send symposium reminders, and handle all narrative follow-ups after auto-migrating any legacy rows from the `followups` table.【F:great_work/state.py†L344-L720】【F:great_work/service.py†L1996-L4360】
- **Status:** Moderator tooling now exists. Operators can list and cancel dispatcher orders via `/gw_admin list_orders` and `/gw_admin cancel_order`; the telemetry dashboard adds filtering plus CSV/JSON export at `/api/orders` and `/api/orders.csv` for audits.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L2128-L2231】【F:ops/telemetry-dashboard/app.py†L86-L144】

## 7. Data Model and Persistence

- **Design intent:** Persist players, scholars, relationships, theories, expeditions, offers, press artefacts, and events with exports available through a bot command.【F:docs/HLD.md†L203-L385】
- **Implementation status:** SQLite schema covers all major entities including offers, mentorships, conferences, symposium topics/votes, and press; the new `orders` table centralises delayed work (mentorship activations, conference resolutions) consumed by the orders dispatcher, while exports flow through `/export_log` and archive tooling.【F:great_work/state.py†L18-L520】【F:great_work/service.py†L1402-L1880】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L562-L737】
- **Status:** Exportable order snapshots are in place via the dashboard (`/api/orders`, `/api/orders.csv`), the new `/api/orders` filters plus the dispatcher form support event/age/pending constraints, and `python -m great_work.tools.manage_orders` provides dry-run migration previews and JSON summaries for audits.【F:ops/telemetry-dashboard/app.py†L1-L230】【F:docs/TELEMETRY_RUNBOOK.md†L20-L140】

## 8. Discord Command Surface and Admin Tools

- **Design intent:** Provide slash commands for theories, wagers, recruitment, expeditions, conferences, status checks, log exports, and admin hotfixes, with telemetry on usage.【F:docs/HLD.md†L248-L386】
- **Implementation status:** Commands cover the expected surface, including `/poach`, `/counter`, `/view_offers`, `/mentor`, `/assign_lab`, `/conference`, `/export_web_archive`, `/telemetry_report`, and `/gw_admin` subcommands for moderation. All commands now share the telemetry decorator, emitting player, channel, success metrics, layered-press counts, and digest health; operators can review stats via Discord or the bundled telemetry dashboard container.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L123-L940】【F:great_work/telemetry_decorator.py†L12-L80】【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L72-L660】【F:ops/telemetry-dashboard/app.py†L1-L64】
- **Status:** `/theory_reference` now posts a pin-ready embed summarising recent theories, deadlines, and supporter rolls so table-talk can keep a live index; enhanced dispatcher console filtering/search remains outstanding for moderator triage at scale.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L660-L741】【F:great_work/service.py†L2615-L2675】【F:tests/test_service_theories.py†L118-L162】【F:ops/telemetry-dashboard/app.py†L86-L173】

### 8.1 Credentials and application configuration

- **Design intent:** Document the runtime configuration (token, app id, channel routing) required to deploy the bot.【F:docs/HLD.md†L248-L286】
- **Implementation status:** The bot reads environment variables for IDs and channel routing, but the design docs still omit a deployment appendix describing the expected configuration.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L69-L113】
- **Gap:** Add a short configuration section to docs so operators understand required environment variables and channel mapping.

## 9. LLM and Narrative Integration

- **Design intent:** Generate press and reactions through persona-driven LLM prompts with batching and safety controls.【F:docs/HLD.md†L318-L369】
- **Implementation status:** The LLM client now drives expeditions, defection negotiations, symposium updates, mentorship beats, theory submissions, table-talk posts, and admin notices with persona metadata, retry scheduling, and blocklist safeguards; layered press metrics feed telemetry and tests run in mock mode to verify prompts and pause behaviour.【F:great_work/service.py†L300-L1080】【F:great_work/service.py†L553-L704】【F:great_work/service.py†L631-L704】【F:great_work/llm_client.py†L1-L240】【F:tests/test_game_service.py†L80-L196】【F:tests/test_symposium.py†L20-L69】
- **Status:** Guardian moderation now runs pre/post passes via the sidecar/local pipeline, hashed overrides can be registered from Discord (`/gw_admin add_moderation_override`) or the CLI (`python -m great_work.tools.manage_orders followups migrate`), and the safety plan documents calibration plus escalation workflows. Remaining follow-up: calibrate thresholds using live Guardian scores and expand the incident response drill once playtest data is available.【F:great_work/moderation.py†L1-L240】【F:great_work/service.py†L200-L360】【F:docs/SAFETY_PLAN.md†L60-L120】【F:docs/NARRATIVE_LICENSE.md†L1-L120】

## Summary of Major Gaps

1. Seasonal commitments, faction projects, faction investments, and archive endowments now anchor long-tail pressure; next quantify balance via telemetry (alert thresholds, dashboards) and decide how relationship deltas unlock additional late-game content.
2. Validate new faction investment/endowment knobs against live telemetry so late-game influence pressure stays meaningful without overwhelming players; fold findings into the economy playbook.
3. Symposium scoring now surfaces weighting math and reprisal cadence; keep tuning heuristics with the new telemetry guardrails and iterate on the published runbook as playtests surface edge cases.【F:docs/TELEMETRY_RUNBOOK.md†L1-L140】
4. Telemetry guardrails (including seasonal commitment alerts) now emit webhook/email notifications, support multi-webhook fan-out for on-call channels, surface product KPIs (active player counts, manifesto adoption, archive reach), and chart daily history/sparklines in `/telemetry_report` + the dashboard. KPI targets persist inside `telemetry.db`, override alert thresholds automatically, the dashboard shows new-vs-returning engagement cohorts and symposium participation mixes, `/gw_admin calibration_snapshot` + `python -m great_work.tools.export_calibration_snapshot` capture tuning snapshots (backed by `python -m great_work.tools.generate_sample_telemetry` for dry runs), and the dashboard exposes `/api/calibration_snapshot` alongside the on-call playbook updates. `python -m great_work.tools.recommend_kpi_thresholds --apply` now persists tuned guardrails, `python -m great_work.tools.export_product_metrics` archives KPI/cohort snapshots for offline analysis, and `python -m great_work.tools.simulate_seasonal_economy` lets ops rehearse seasonal commitment + mentorship tuning scenarios offline. Remaining follow-up: analyse real playtest telemetry to lock seasonal/investment defaults once live data arrives.【F:great_work/analytics/calibration.py†L1-L244】【F:great_work/tools/recommend_kpi_thresholds.py†L15-L178】【F:great_work/tools/export_product_metrics.py†L1-L83】【F:great_work/tools/simulate_seasonal_economy.py†L1-L209】【F:docs/TELEMETRY_RUNBOOK.md†L1-L240】
5. Static archives now auto-export, mirror into GitHub Pages, prune old snapshots, and alert operators when disk usage crosses the configured threshold.
