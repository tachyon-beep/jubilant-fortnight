# Requirements Evaluation Report

Last Updated: 2025-09-20 (Phase 3 telemetry & dispatcher audit)

## Executive Summary

- **Fully Implemented:** 55 requirements (71.4%)
- **Partially Implemented:** 10 requirements (13.0%)
- **Not Implemented:** 10 requirements (13.0%)
- **Not Evaluated:** 2 requirements (2.6%)

Core gameplay and community loops function end to end. LLM-enhanced, multi-layer press now stages follow-ups for expeditions, defections, symposiums, and admin flows, telemetry instrumentation spans every command with channel metrics and LLM latency, and digest exports ship ZIP snapshots to the admin channel. Remaining gaps centre on mentorship/admin press cadence, telemetry dashboards, success metrics, and automated archive hosting.

## Functional Requirements Status

### Core Gameplay Loop and Transparency (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 2 | 50% |
| Partially Implemented | 2 | 50% |

**Notes:** All primary moves run through Discord and the shared timeline advances correctly, but player-count guardrails and “all moves are public” remain partial because several actions reply ephemerally rather than posting to shared channels.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L209-L637】【F:great_work/service.py†L1700-L2059】

### Scholar Management (6 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 6 | 100% |

**Notes:** Roster enforcement, procedural generation, mentorship-driven careers, sidecasts, and multi-stage defection arcs all operate via the service layer and persistence tables.【F:great_work/service.py†L520-L1105】【F:great_work/state.py†L636-L944】

### Confidence Wagering (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Confidence levels gate actions, wager tables clamp reputation, and high-stakes wagers impose recruitment cooldowns surfaced to players via `/status` and `/wager`.【F:great_work/service.py†L125-L392】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L523-L571】

### Expeditions and Outcomes (10 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 10 | 100% |

**Notes:** Expedition costs, modifiers, d100 resolution, depth-aware failure tables, sideways effects, and great projects match the detailed design.【F:great_work/service.py†L170-L392】【F:great_work/expeditions.py†L60-L213】

### Influence Economy (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Five-dimensional influence vectors persist per player, clamp to reputation-derived caps, and adjust through expeditions, recruitment, and offers with escrow tracking.【F:great_work/service.py†L677-L835】【F:great_work/state.py†L18-L170】

### Press Artefacts and Gazette Cadence (6 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 2 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 4 | 67% |

**Notes:** Gazette digests and symposium cadence run on schedule. Expedition, defection, symposium, and admin press now layer in gossip, faction statements, and LLM-enhanced narration with scheduled follow-ups; mentorship/admin maintenance beats still post single-layer copy and digest summaries do not highlight queued drops.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L138】【F:great_work/service.py†L300-L2060】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L20-L230】

### Discord UX and Commands (10 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 10 | 100% |

**Notes:** Slash commands cover theories, wagers, recruitment, expeditions, conferences, mentorship, offers, archives, telemetry, and admin overrides, all wired to service methods and wrapped in the shared telemetry decorator for usage tracking.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L123-L940】【F:great_work/telemetry_decorator.py†L12-L80】

## Non-Functional Requirements Status

### Target Audience and Scale (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Not Evaluated | 1 | 33% |

**Notes:** Digest pacing fits small groups, but complexity benchmarking is unevaluated and tooling for moderation at scale is still limited.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L95】【F:docs/HLD.md†L386-L430】

### Narrative Tone and Consistency (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Not Implemented | 1 | 33% |

**Notes:** Template consistency is enforced and LLM narration now enhances expedition, defection, symposium, and admin artefacts; mentorship/table-talk flows still lean on static templates and several replies remain ephemeral instead of public.【F:great_work/service.py†L300-L1995】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L523-L772】

### Pacing and Engagement (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Gazette digests, symposium heartbeat, and idle-friendly command structure all match the pacing goals.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L95】【F:great_work/service.py†L1295-L1448】

### Reproducibility and Auditability (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 100% |

**Notes:** Deterministic RNG, comprehensive event logs, and export tooling support replay and audit scenarios.【F:great_work/service.py†L86-L214】【F:great_work/state.py†L200-L417】

### Cost and Operational Control (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 25% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 25% |
| Not Implemented | 2 | 50% |

**Notes:** Scheduler-based maintenance exists with pause/resume automation and admin notifications, yet LLM batching/length controls are pending and posting frequency is not rate-limited beyond the digest cadence.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L120】【F:great_work/service.py†L90-L230】

### Licensing and Safety (5 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 20% |
| Not Implemented | 4 | 80% |

**Notes:** Code remains MIT-licensed, yet narrative asset licensing, blocklists, manual review guidelines, and MPL/CC licenses are still missing.【F:LICENSE†L1-L21】【F:docs/HLD.md†L354-L410】

### Success Criteria and Iteration (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Not Implemented | 3 | 75% |
| Not Evaluated | 1 | 25% |

**Notes:** No telemetry tracks nickname adoption, press sharing, or manifesto creation, and iteration metrics remain undefined pending live playtests.【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L12-L320】

### Open-Source Readiness (5 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 80% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 20% |

**Notes:** Structured YAML assets, deterministic tooling, admin utilities, and licensing support for forks are in place. API-level and deployment documentation still require expansion.【F:great_work/data/settings.yaml†L1-L28】【F:great_work/rng.py†L1-L63】【F:docs/HLD.md†L1-L386】

### Accessibility of Records (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 100% |

**Notes:** Press/events persist in SQLite, `/export_log` and `/export_web_archive` expose history, `/archive_link` provides permalinks, and digest ticks ship ZIP snapshots to the admin channel—meeting archival accessibility requirements even though external hosting remains manual.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L577-L737】【F:great_work/web_archive.py†L416-L520】【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L120】

## Key Follow-ups

1. Extend layered press cadence (mentorship/admin maintenance, digest highlights) and complete persona coverage for remaining commands.
2. Build telemetry dashboards, layered-press metrics, and success criteria tracking before external playtests.
3. Automate archive hosting/snapshot rotation and fold operator runbook guidance into public deployment/configuration docs.
