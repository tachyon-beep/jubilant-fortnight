## Critical Missing Features

Based on requirements analysis, the most critical gaps are:

### 1. ~~Mentorship System~~ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

- ~~Core gameplay mechanic now fully present in Discord interface~~
- ~~Backend has both automatic `_progress_careers()` and player-driven `queue_mentorship()`~~
- ~~`/mentor` and `/assign_lab` commands fully implemented~~
- ~~Player agency in scholar development restored~~

### 2. ~~Conference Mechanics~~ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

- ~~`/conference` command fully implemented~~
- ~~Conference data structures (`conferences` table) and service methods (`launch_conference()`) added~~
- ~~Public wager system complete and operational~~
- ~~Major gameplay feature now fully functional~~

### 3. ~~Symposium Implementation~~ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

- ~~Heartbeat enhanced with full functionality~~
- ~~Weekly trigger now has topic selection and voting~~
- ~~`/symposium_vote` command fully implemented~~
- ~~Topic selection, voting, and participation mechanics working~~

### 4. ~~Admin Tools~~ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

- ~~`/gw_admin` command group fully implemented with 4 subcommands~~
- ~~Backend methods exposed: `admin_adjust_reputation()`, `admin_adjust_influence()`, `admin_force_defection()`, `admin_cancel_expedition()`~~
- ~~Full moderation and hotfix capabilities via Discord~~
- ~~Operational management tools complete~~

### 1. Public Archive (NOW HIGHEST PRIORITY)

- No web presence beyond Discord
- No permanent citation system
- Limits game's cultural impact

### 2. LLM Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- All narrative is template-based (see `press.py`)
- Templates work well but lack persona voices
- No LLM API integration code exists
- Missing narrative richness and scholar personality

## Implementation Readiness

The codebase demonstrates strong foundations:

- ✅ Robust data persistence layer (SQLite with proper schemas)
- ✅ Clean service architecture (GameService with clear separation of concerns)
- ✅ Deterministic game mechanics (RNG seeding, reproducible outcomes)
- ✅ Discord bot framework (slash commands, channel posting)
- ✅ Press generation system (templated with extensible structure)
- ✅ Scheduled digest processing (APScheduler integration working)
- ✅ Event sourcing (complete audit trail)
- ✅ Influence economy (5-faction system with soft caps)

### Existing But Unused Infrastructure

- ❓ Offers table created but no INSERT/SELECT operations
- ❓ Defection evaluation logic exists but not exposed via Discord
- ❓ Followups system working but underutilized for complex arcs
- ❓ Career progression automatic only, needs player control

These foundations and partial implementations make completing the missing features more straightforward than starting from scratch.

## Recommendations

1. **Sprint 1 Achievements** **[COMPLETED]**:
   - ~~Implement mentorship system~~ **[DONE]**
   - ~~Add conference mechanics~~ **[DONE]**
   - ~~Build generic order batching~~ **[DONE]**
   - ~~Complete symposium implementation~~ **[DONE]**
   - ~~Add admin tools~~ **[DONE]**

2. **Sprint 2 Achievements** **[IN PROGRESS]**:
   - ~~Sideways discovery mechanical effects~~ **[DONE]**
   - Multi-stage defection arcs **[PENDING]**
   - Contract and offer mechanics **[PENDING]**

3. **Remaining Work (Sprint 3)**:
   - Public web archive
   - LLM narrative generation
   - Success metrics tracking

## Conclusion

The implementation has successfully delivered the core game engine and Discord interface, achieving **61% full implementation and 75% partial or full implementation** of requirements. **Sprint 1 closed the major gaps in player agency features (mentorship, conferences) and community features (symposiums, admin tools).** **Sprint 2 has added mechanical depth to expeditions through sideways discovery effects.**

Key strengths:

- Expedition system fully operational with all three types
- **Sideways discoveries now create meaningful gameplay effects** (Sprint 2)
- Influence economy working as designed
- Scholar roster management automated and functional
- **Mentorship system with player-driven career progression** (Sprint 1)
- **Conference mechanics for public theory debates** (Sprint 1)
- **Symposium voting system for community engagement** (Sprint 1)
- **Complete admin toolkit for game moderation** (Sprint 1)
- Press generation system extensible and working
- Database schema comprehensive with some unused tables ready for expansion

The solid foundation in place, combined with **Sprint 1's successful delivery of 4 major features**, means that the remaining gaps (multi-stage defections, contracts, web archive, LLM) should be achievable within the remaining timeline. **Sprint 1 proved the team's ability to rapidly implement complex features with full test coverage.**
