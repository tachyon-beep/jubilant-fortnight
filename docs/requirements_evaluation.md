# Requirements Evaluation Report

Last Updated: 2025-10-01 (Guardian moderation, seasonal telemetry)

## Executive Summary

- **Fully Implemented:** 55 requirements (71.4%)
- **Partially Implemented:** 11 requirements (14.3%)
- **Not Implemented:** 9 requirements (11.7%)
- **Not Evaluated:** 2 requirements (2.6%)

 Core gameplay and community loops function end to end. LLM-enhanced, multi-layer press now stages follow-ups across expeditions, defections, symposiums, mentorship beats, admin flows, recruitment briefs, table-talk updates, sidecasts, and sideways vignettes; Guardian moderation vets both player inputs and generated copy. Digest highlights summarise scheduled drops, telemetry reports include dispatcher backlog stats plus seasonal commitment debt, and digest exports sync the public archive with ZIP snapshots. The telemetry guardrails now capture product KPIs (active player counts, manifesto adoption, archive reach), chart daily trends in Discord + the dashboard, and can fan out alerts to multiple on-call webhooks; remaining gaps centre on tuning mentorship/sidecast outcomes, balancing long-tail influence sinks, and defining KPI targets once live playtest data arrives.

## Functional Requirements Status

### Core Gameplay Loop and Transparency (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 2 | 50% |
| Partially Implemented | 2 | 50% |

**Notes:** All primary moves run through Discord and the shared timeline advances correctly, but player-count guardrails and “all moves are public” remain partial because several actions reply ephemerally rather than posting to shared channels.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L209-L637】【F:great_work/service.py†L1700-L2059】

### Scholar Management (6 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 6 | 100% |

**Notes:** Roster enforcement, procedural generation, mentorship-driven careers, sidecasts, and multi-stage defection/return arcs operate via the service layer and persistence tables, including scars and memory shifts applied during negotiations.【F:great_work/service.py†L520-L1600】【F:great_work/state.py†L636-L944】

### Confidence Wagering (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Confidence levels gate actions, wager tables clamp reputation, and high-stakes wagers impose recruitment cooldowns surfaced to players via `/status`, `/wager`, and the new `/recruit_odds` preview table.【F:great_work/service.py†L1009-L1110】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L317-L381】

### Expeditions and Outcomes (10 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 10 | 100% |

**Notes:** Expedition costs, modifiers, d100 resolution, depth-aware failure tables, sideways effects, and great projects match the detailed design.【F:great_work/service.py†L170-L392】【F:great_work/expeditions.py†L60-L213】

### Influence Economy (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Five-dimensional influence vectors persist per player, clamp to reputation-derived caps, and adjust through expeditions, recruitment, symposium pledges, contract upkeep, seasonal commitments, faction projects, and the new long-tail sinks (`/invest`, `/endow_archive`), all surfaced in `/status` and telemetry.【F:great_work/service.py†L677-L4490】【F:great_work/state.py†L18-L2440】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L883-L1607】

### Press Artefacts and Gazette Cadence (6 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 2 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 4 | 67% |

**Notes:** Gazette digests and symposium cadence run on schedule. Expedition, defection, symposium, mentorship, conference, recruitment, table-talk, sidecast, archive, admin, and long-tail economy artefacts (faction investments/endowments) layer in LLM-enhanced gossip, faction statements, and scheduled follow-ups; Guardian moderation now screens player inputs and generated press. Tone packs randomise setting-specific headlines, digest highlights summarise pending drops, sideways vignettes trigger narrative dispatches while `/symposium_status`, `/symposium_backlog`, and telemetry reports surface pledge/grace stakes, scoring weights, component breakdowns (age decay, fresh bonus, repeat penalty), and debt reprisal schedules with faction reprisals. Mentorship activations/progression/completions log relationship history and adjust scholar feelings alongside sidecast phases, `/status` exposes the summary, recruitment odds incorporate the relationship modifier, and seasonal commitments/faction projects/investments/endowments use the same signals for costs, progress, or reputation rewards with admin overrides. Remaining work targets propagating those deltas into poach loyalty and promoting informational commands to public artefacts.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L200】【F:great_work/service.py†L170-L4700】【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L788-L1504】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L317-L1607】【F:great_work/multi_press.py†L320-L1120】【F:docs/WRITING_GUIDE.md†L1-L160】【F:great_work/moderation.py†L1-L240】

### Discord UX and Commands (10 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 10 | 100% |

**Notes:** Slash commands cover theories, wagers, recruitment, expeditions, conferences, mentorship, offers, archives, telemetry, and admin overrides, all wired to service methods and wrapped in the shared telemetry decorator with layered-press and digest metrics surfaced via Discord and the bundled dashboard container.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L123-L940】【F:great_work/telemetry_decorator.py†L12-L80】【F:ops/telemetry-dashboard/app.py†L1-L64】

## Non-Functional Requirements Status

### Target Audience and Scale (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Not Evaluated | 1 | 33% |

**Notes:** Digest pacing fits small groups, but complexity benchmarking is unevaluated and tooling for moderation at scale is still limited.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L95】【F:docs/HLD.md†L386-L430】

### Narrative Tone and Consistency (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 2 | 67% |

**Notes:** Template consistency is enforced and LLM narration now enhances expedition, defection, symposium, mentorship, theory, table-talk, and admin artefacts with persona metadata while Guardian moderation vets safety; remaining gaps involve promoting informational replies into shared channels and surfacing mentorship/sidecast state snapshots for players.【F:great_work/service.py†L300-L1100】【F:great_work/service.py†L553-L704】【F:great_work/service.py†L631-L704】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L720-L940】【F:great_work/moderation.py†L1-L240】

### Pacing and Engagement (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Gazette digests, symposium heartbeat, and idle-friendly command structure all match the pacing goals.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L95】【F:great_work/service.py†L1295-L1448】

### Reproducibility and Auditability (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 100% |

**Notes:** Deterministic RNG, comprehensive event logs, and export tooling support replay and audit scenarios.【F:great_work/service.py†L86-L214】【F:great_work/state.py†L200-L417】

### Cost and Operational Control (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 25% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 25% |
| Not Implemented | 2 | 50% |

**Notes:** Scheduler-based maintenance exists with pause/resume automation, configurable retry schedules, admin notifications, and webhook/email-driven alert routing; telemetry guardrails plus the runbook surface symposium debt, investment concentration, queue depth, seasonal commitments, and digest health for on-call operators. Remaining gaps: LLM batching/length controls and deeper integration of the alerts with product-facing tooling.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L180】【F:great_work/service.py†L90-L4400】【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L920-L1504】【F:docs/TELEMETRY_RUNBOOK.md†L1-L140】

### Licensing and Safety (5 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 20% |
| Not Implemented | 4 | 80% |

**Notes:** Code remains MIT-licensed, yet narrative asset licensing, blocklists, manual review guidelines, and MPL/CC licenses are still missing.【F:LICENSE†L1-L21】【F:docs/HLD.md†L354-L410】

### Success Criteria and Iteration (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Not Implemented | 3 | 75% |
| Not Evaluated | 1 | 25% |

**Notes:** Telemetry now tracks manifesto adoption and archive lookups (with calibration helpers to derive KPI/seasonal thresholds), but nickname adoption and press sharing remain uninstrumented; iteration metrics remain undefined pending live playtests.【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L12-L320】【F:great_work/tools/recommend_kpi_thresholds.py†L1-L160】【F:great_work/tools/recommend_seasonal_settings.py†L1-L120】

### Open-Source Readiness (5 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 80% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 20% |

**Notes:** Structured YAML assets, deterministic tooling, admin utilities, and licensing support for forks are in place. API-level and deployment documentation still require expansion.【F:great_work/data/settings.yaml†L1-L28】【F:great_work/rng.py†L1-L63】【F:docs/HLD.md†L1-L386】

### Accessibility of Records (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 100% |

**Notes:** Press/events persist in SQLite, `/export_log` and `/export_web_archive` expose history, `/archive_link` provides permalinks, digest ticks ship ZIP snapshots to the admin channel, and the scheduler now mirrors exports into a GitHub Pages repository with documented operator workflow.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L577-L737】【F:great_work/web_archive.py†L416-L520】【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L260】

## Key Follow-ups

1. Use the new telemetry guardrails (symposium debt, seasonal commitments, queue depth) during playtests and iterate on thresholds/runbook guidance based on observed load.
2. Design and document additional influence sinks (faction investments, archive programs) that pair with symposium debt escalation.
3. Run the KPI and seasonal calibration helpers after each playtest to update engagement/manifesto/archive thresholds and seasonal defaults/alerts, then ensure the resulting guardrails land in the on-call tooling.
