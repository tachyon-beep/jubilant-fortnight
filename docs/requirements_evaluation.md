# Requirements Evaluation Report

Last Updated: 2025-09-27 (Phase 3 telemetry & narrative refresh)

## Executive Summary

- **Fully Implemented:** 55 requirements (71.4%)
- **Partially Implemented:** 11 requirements (14.3%)
- **Not Implemented:** 9 requirements (11.7%)
- **Not Evaluated:** 2 requirements (2.6%)

Core gameplay and community loops function end to end. LLM-enhanced, multi-layer press now stages follow-ups across expeditions, defections, symposiums, mentorship beats, admin flows, and table-talk/theory updates, digest highlights summarise scheduled drops, telemetry reports include queue depth alongside layered-press cadence, and digest exports sync the public archive with ZIP snapshots. Remaining gaps centre on layered coverage for recruitment/table-talk follow-ups, telemetry success thresholds and dispatcher instrumentation, and external archive hardening.

## Functional Requirements Status

### Core Gameplay Loop and Transparency (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 2 | 50% |
| Partially Implemented | 2 | 50% |

**Notes:** All primary moves run through Discord and the shared timeline advances correctly, but player-count guardrails and “all moves are public” remain partial because several actions reply ephemerally rather than posting to shared channels.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L209-L637】【F:great_work/service.py†L1700-L2059】

### Scholar Management (6 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 6 | 100% |

**Notes:** Roster enforcement, procedural generation, mentorship-driven careers, sidecasts, and multi-stage defection/return arcs operate via the service layer and persistence tables, including scars and memory shifts applied during negotiations.【F:great_work/service.py†L520-L1600】【F:great_work/state.py†L636-L944】

### Confidence Wagering (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Confidence levels gate actions, wager tables clamp reputation, and high-stakes wagers impose recruitment cooldowns surfaced to players via `/status`, `/wager`, and the new `/recruit_odds` preview table.【F:great_work/service.py†L1009-L1110】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L317-L381】

### Expeditions and Outcomes (10 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 10 | 100% |

**Notes:** Expedition costs, modifiers, d100 resolution, depth-aware failure tables, sideways effects, and great projects match the detailed design.【F:great_work/service.py†L170-L392】【F:great_work/expeditions.py†L60-L213】

### Influence Economy (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Five-dimensional influence vectors persist per player, clamp to reputation-derived caps, and adjust through expeditions, recruitment, symposium pledges, and contract upkeep with debt/repraisal tracking surfaced in `/status` and telemetry.【F:great_work/service.py†L677-L1110】【F:great_work/state.py†L18-L520】

### Press Artefacts and Gazette Cadence (6 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 2 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 4 | 67% |

**Notes:** Gazette digests and symposium cadence run on schedule. Expedition, defection, symposium, mentorship, conference, and admin press layer in LLM-enhanced gossip, faction statements, and scheduled follow-ups; digest highlights summarise pending drops, symposium reminders plus `/symposium_status`, `/symposium_backlog`, and telemetry reports surface pledge/grace stakes, scoring weights, and debt rollovers with faction reprisals, yet recruitment/table-talk coverage remains single-beat and sideways templates stay hand-authored.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L200】【F:great_work/service.py†L220-L2700】【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L788-L890】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L640-L780】【F:great_work/multi_press.py†L180-L520】

### Discord UX and Commands (10 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 10 | 100% |

**Notes:** Slash commands cover theories, wagers, recruitment, expeditions, conferences, mentorship, offers, archives, telemetry, and admin overrides, all wired to service methods and wrapped in the shared telemetry decorator with layered-press and digest metrics surfaced via Discord and the bundled dashboard container.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L123-L940】【F:great_work/telemetry_decorator.py†L12-L80】【F:ops/telemetry-dashboard/app.py†L1-L64】

## Non-Functional Requirements Status

### Target Audience and Scale (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Not Evaluated | 1 | 33% |

**Notes:** Digest pacing fits small groups, but complexity benchmarking is unevaluated and tooling for moderation at scale is still limited.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L95】【F:docs/HLD.md†L386-L430】

### Narrative Tone and Consistency (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 33% |
| Partially Implemented | 2 | 67% |

**Notes:** Template consistency is enforced and LLM narration now enhances expedition, defection, symposium, mentorship, theory, table-talk, and admin artefacts with persona metadata; remaining gaps involve richer moderation/guard rails and ensuring informational replies surface publicly rather than ephemerally.【F:great_work/service.py†L300-L1100】【F:great_work/service.py†L553-L704】【F:great_work/service.py†L631-L704】【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L720-L940】【F:great_work/llm_client.py†L40-L180】

### Pacing and Engagement (3 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 3 | 100% |

**Notes:** Gazette digests, symposium heartbeat, and idle-friendly command structure all match the pacing goals.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L95】【F:great_work/service.py†L1295-L1448】

### Reproducibility and Auditability (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 100% |

**Notes:** Deterministic RNG, comprehensive event logs, and export tooling support replay and audit scenarios.【F:great_work/service.py†L86-L214】【F:great_work/state.py†L200-L417】

### Cost and Operational Control (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 25% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 25% |
| Not Implemented | 2 | 50% |

**Notes:** Scheduler-based maintenance exists with pause/resume automation, configurable retry schedules, and admin notifications, yet LLM guard-rail batching/length controls are pending and posting frequency is not rate-limited beyond the digest cadence.【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L180】【F:great_work/service.py†L90-L320】【F:great_work/llm_client.py†L1-L200】

### Licensing and Safety (5 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 1 | 20% |
| Not Implemented | 4 | 80% |

**Notes:** Code remains MIT-licensed, yet narrative asset licensing, blocklists, manual review guidelines, and MPL/CC licenses are still missing.【F:LICENSE†L1-L21】【F:docs/HLD.md†L354-L410】

### Success Criteria and Iteration (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Not Implemented | 3 | 75% |
| Not Evaluated | 1 | 25% |

**Notes:** No telemetry tracks nickname adoption, press sharing, or manifesto creation, and iteration metrics remain undefined pending live playtests.【F:great_work/telemetry.py†L12-L320】

### Open-Source Readiness (5 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 80% |
| Partially Implemented | 1 | 20% |

**Notes:** Structured YAML assets, deterministic tooling, admin utilities, and licensing support for forks are in place. API-level and deployment documentation still require expansion.【F:great_work/data/settings.yaml†L1-L28】【F:great_work/rng.py†L1-L63】【F:docs/HLD.md†L1-L386】

### Accessibility of Records (4 requirements)

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Fully Implemented | 4 | 100% |

**Notes:** Press/events persist in SQLite, `/export_log` and `/export_web_archive` expose history, `/archive_link` provides permalinks, and digest ticks ship ZIP snapshots to the admin channel—meeting archival accessibility requirements even though external hosting remains manual.【F:great_work/discord_bot.py†L577-L737】【F:great_work/web_archive.py†L416-L520】【F:great_work/scheduler.py†L20-L120】

## Key Follow-ups

1. Add layered coverage and template variety for recruitment/table-talk follow-ups and sideways discoveries.
2. Define telemetry success thresholds, dispatcher/order instrumentation, and operator-facing escalation runbooks.
3. Document external archive hosting options and production hardening for the containerised static site.
