## Critical Missing Features

Based on requirements analysis, the most critical gaps are:

### 1. Mentorship System (HIGH PRIORITY)

- Core gameplay mechanic completely absent from Discord interface
- Backend has `_progress_careers()` but only automatic progression
- No `/mentor` or `/assign_lab` commands implemented
- Blocks player agency in scholar development

### 2. Conference Mechanics (HIGH PRIORITY)

- `/conference` command not implemented
- No conference data structures or service methods
- Public wager system incomplete despite confidence wagers working
- Major gameplay feature missing entirely

### 3. Symposium Implementation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- Only heartbeat exists in `scheduler.py` (`_host_symposium` method)
- Weekly trigger works but no actual functionality
- No `/symposium_vote` command
- No topic selection, voting, or participation mechanics

### 4. Admin Tools (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- No `/gw_admin` command group implemented
- Backend has `evaluate_defection_offer()` but not exposed
- No moderation or hotfix capabilities via Discord
- Critical for operational management

### 5. Public Archive (LOW PRIORITY)

- No web presence beyond Discord
- No permanent citation system
- Limits game's cultural impact

### 6. LLM Integration (LOW PRIORITY)

- All narrative is template-based (see `press.py`)
- Templates work well but lack persona voices
- No LLM API integration code exists
- Missing narrative richness and scholar personality

## Implementation Readiness

The codebase demonstrates strong foundations:

- ✅ Robust data persistence layer (SQLite with proper schemas)
- ✅ Clean service architecture (GameService with clear separation of concerns)
- ✅ Deterministic game mechanics (RNG seeding, reproducible outcomes)
- ✅ Discord bot framework (slash commands, channel posting)
- ✅ Press generation system (templated with extensible structure)
- ✅ Scheduled digest processing (APScheduler integration working)
- ✅ Event sourcing (complete audit trail)
- ✅ Influence economy (5-faction system with soft caps)

### Existing But Unused Infrastructure

- ❓ Offers table created but no INSERT/SELECT operations
- ❓ Defection evaluation logic exists but not exposed via Discord
- ❓ Followups system working but underutilized for complex arcs
- ❓ Career progression automatic only, needs player control

These foundations and partial implementations make completing the missing features more straightforward than starting from scratch.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus (Phase 1)**:
   - Implement mentorship system
   - Add conference mechanics
   - Build generic order batching
   - Gate Great Projects properly

2. **Near-term Goals (Phase 2)**:
   - Complete symposium implementation
   - Add admin tools
   - Enhance defection arcs

3. **Future Enhancements (Phase 3)**:
   - Public web archive
   - LLM narrative generation
   - Success metrics tracking

## Conclusion

The implementation has successfully delivered the core game engine and Discord interface, achieving 44% full implementation and 66% partial or full implementation of requirements. The major gaps are in player agency features (mentorship, conferences) and community features (symposiums, admin tools) rather than technical infrastructure.

Key strengths:

- Expedition system fully operational with all three types
- Influence economy working as designed
- Scholar roster management automated and functional
- Press generation system extensible and working
- Database schema comprehensive with some unused tables ready for expansion

The solid foundation in place, combined with existing but unused infrastructure (offers table, defection logic in service layer), means that closing the gaps should be achievable within the proposed 6-week timeline. Most missing features require Discord command exposure and integration rather than fundamental backend development.
