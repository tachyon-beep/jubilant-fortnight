## Critical Missing Features

Based on requirements analysis, the most critical gaps are:

### 1. Mentorship System (HIGH PRIORITY)

- Core gameplay mechanic completely absent
- Only automatic career progression exists
- Blocks player agency in scholar development

### 2. Conference Mechanics (HIGH PRIORITY)

- `/conference` command not implemented
- Public wager system incomplete
- Major gameplay feature missing

### 3. Symposium Implementation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- Only heartbeat exists, no actual functionality
- Weekly community engagement feature absent
- No topic selection, voting, or participation

### 4. Admin Tools (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- No Discord admin commands
- No moderation capabilities
- Critical for operational management

### 5. Public Archive (LOW PRIORITY)

- No web presence beyond Discord
- No permanent citation system
- Limits game's cultural impact

### 6. LLM Integration (LOW PRIORITY)

- All narrative is template-based
- No persona voices
- Missing narrative richness

## Implementation Readiness

The codebase demonstrates strong foundations:

- ✅ Robust data persistence layer
- ✅ Clean service architecture
- ✅ Deterministic game mechanics
- ✅ Discord bot framework
- ✅ Press generation system
- ✅ Scheduled digest processing

These foundations make implementing the missing features straightforward.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus (Phase 1)**:
   - Implement mentorship system
   - Add conference mechanics
   - Build generic order batching
   - Gate Great Projects properly

2. **Near-term Goals (Phase 2)**:
   - Complete symposium implementation
   - Add admin tools
   - Enhance defection arcs

3. **Future Enhancements (Phase 3)**:
   - Public web archive
   - LLM narrative generation
   - Success metrics tracking

## Conclusion

The implementation has successfully delivered the core game engine and Discord interface, achieving 43% full implementation and 67% partial or full implementation of requirements. The major gaps are in player agency features (mentorship, conferences) and community features (symposiums, admin tools) rather than technical infrastructure. With the solid foundation in place, closing these gaps should be achievable within the proposed 6-week timeline.
