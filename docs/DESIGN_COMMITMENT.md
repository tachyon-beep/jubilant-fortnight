# Full Design Commitment

Date: 2025-09-19

## Decision

We're committing to implement the **full design vision** with no deferrals or postponements. All features described in the High-Level Design will be built within the 6-week implementation timeline.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed All Deferrals

- ✅ Great Projects no longer deferred - already implemented correctly
- ✅ Platform expansion (Signal/Telegram) reframed as community-driven additions
- ✅ All narrative references updated to present tense

### 2. Updated Documentation

- **HLD.md**: Removed MVP note deferring Great Projects
- **gap_analysis.md**: Great Projects reclassified from "premature" to "correctly implemented"
- **implementation_plan.md**: Renamed to "Full Design Build" with commitment to all features
- **requirements_*.md**: Updated to reflect full scope commitment

### 3. Revised Priorities

#### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2) - Core Gameplay

- Conference mechanics
- Mentorship system
- Generic order batching
- Sideways discovery mechanics

#### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4) - Community Features

- Full symposium implementation
- Admin tools
- Multi-stage defection arcs
- Contract mechanics

#### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6) - Polish & Narrative

- LLM narrative generation (now MEDIUM priority, not optional)
- Public web archive
- Enhanced telemetry
- Safety systems

## Implementation Impact

### Already Complete

- ✅ Great Projects
- ✅ Influence economy
- ✅ Confidence wagers
- ✅ Expedition resolution
- ✅ Basic Discord bot

### Must Build (Critical Path)

1. **Mentorship** - Core gameplay loop incomplete without it
2. **Conferences** - Major missing gameplay feature
3. **Symposiums** - Weekly engagement mechanic
4. **Admin Tools** - Operational necessity
5. **LLM Integration** - Essential for narrative richness

### Risk Management

If timeline pressures emerge, we'll deprioritize Phase 3 polish features rather than Phase 1-2 core gameplay. The game must be mechanically complete even if narrative enhancement comes later.

## Success Criteria

The full design implementation succeeds when:

- All player agency features work (mentorship, conferences)
- Community features engage players (symposiums, admin tools)
- Narrative feels alive (LLM personas, multi-stage arcs)
- Records are permanent (public archive, citations)
- Game is operationally sustainable (moderation, telemetry)

## Commitment Statement

We're building The Great Work as originally envisioned - a complete asynchronous multiplayer experience with rich narrative, complex scholar relationships, and permanent consequences. No shortcuts, no deferrals. We burn for the full design.
