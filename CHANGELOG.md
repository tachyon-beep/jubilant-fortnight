# Changelog

All notable changes to The Great Work Discord game will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Informational commands (`/status`, `/symposium_status`, `/symposium_proposals`, `/symposium_backlog`, `/wager`, `/seasonal_commitments`, `/faction_projects`, `/gazette`, `/export_log`) now publish summaries to the configured public channels while preserving ephemeral confirmations for the caller.
- `/status` surfaces faction sentiment derived from persisted mentorship and sidecast histories so players and operators can audit relationship shifts.
- Telemetry now persists KPI targets (which automatically override alert thresholds), reports engagement cohorts (new vs returning players), and surfaces symposium participation mixes in `/telemetry_report` and the dashboard, including updated FastAPI views/templates.
- Added digest-synced calibration snapshots with `/gw_admin calibration_snapshot`, `python -m great_work.tools.export_calibration_snapshot`, and a dashboard `/api/calibration_snapshot` endpoint; snapshots summarise seasonal debt, faction investments, archive endowments, and pending orders.
- Added `python -m great_work.tools.generate_sample_telemetry` to seed deterministic telemetry data for rehearsal environments.
- Added `python -m great_work.tools.manage_orders` plus enhanced `/gw_admin list_orders` filters/file output and dashboard query controls for dispatcher audits.
- `/status`, `/symposium_backlog`, `/symposium_status`, and `/gazette` now publish rich embeds to public channels, surfacing mentorship histories, symposium scoring heuristics, and recent headlines at a glance. Mentorship/sidecast events grant small faction bonuses and broader vignettes cover espionage/sabotage beats.
- Added `python -m great_work.tools.validate_narrative --all` (and `make validate-narrative`) to statically lint tone packs, recruitment/table-talk/mentorship press, sidecast arcs, epilogues, and vignette catalogues before deployment.
- Added `python -m great_work.tools.preview_narrative` (and `make preview-narrative`) to render sample outputs for narrative surfaces, aiding content review before deploy.
- Landmark expeditions now draw copy from `great_work/data/landmark_preparations.yaml`, including dedicated follow-up briefs previewable via `python -m great_work.tools.preview_narrative landmark-prep`.
- Defection negotiations append a loyalty snapshot summarising current feelings toward the rival and patron, with the same snapshot stored on each offer record and echoed in `/view_offers`.
- Added `python -m great_work.tools.recommend_kpi_thresholds --apply` to compute KPI guardrail recommendations from recent telemetry and persist the tuned targets into `telemetry.db` (with optional JSON exports for audit trails).
- Added `python -m great_work.tools.export_product_metrics` to dump product KPIs, historical trends, and engagement cohorts into `telemetry_exports/` for offline analysis and ops reviews.
- Alert router now reads `GREAT_WORK_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URLS` alongside `GREAT_WORK_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`, enabling multi-channel fan-out without custom code.
