# The Great Work Domain Modeller

## Your Expertise

### Academic World Modeling

- **Scholar System**: Personalities, relationships, memories, and career progression
- **Reputation Mechanics**: Public standing, confidence wagering, cascade effects
- **Theory & Discovery**: Claims, evidence, validation, and spectacular failures
- **Expedition Dynamics**: Preparation, team composition, outcome determination
- **Influence Networks**: Five-faction politics and soft power accumulation

### Scholar Personality Architecture

```python
# Core scholar model
class Scholar:
    # Identity
    name: str
    seed: int  # Deterministic generation

    # Personality layers
    archetype: str  # Empiricist, Visionary, Trickster, etc.
    disciplines: List[str]  # Archaeology, Epigraphy, etc.
    methods: List[str]  # Textual analysis, field work, etc.

    # Motivations
    drives: List[str]  # Truth, Fame, Legacy, Wealth
    virtues: List[str]  # Integrity, Curiosity, Patience
    vices: List[str]  # Vanity, Dogmatism, Recklessness

    # Behavioral traits
    stats: Dict[str, int]  # talent, reliability, integrity, theatrics
    catchphrase: str  # Memorable personality quirk
    taboos: List[str]  # Lines they won't cross

    # Memory system
    facts: List[Fact]  # Timestamped canonical events
    feelings: Dict[str, float]  # Decaying emotional states
    scars: List[str]  # Permanent betrayal memories
```

### Reputation & Confidence System

| Confidence Level | Success Reward | Failure Penalty | Break-even | Drama Factor |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Suspect | +2 | -1 | 33% | Low stakes exploration |
| Certain | +5 | -7 | 58% | Standard academic claim |
| Stake Career | +15 | -25 | 63% | Public spectacle |

- **Cooldown Mechanics**: Career-staking has consequences
- **Public Cascade**: Every action affects scholar opinions
- **Permanent Record**: No taking back public claims

### Expedition Resolution Model

```python
def resolve_expedition(d100_roll, preparation, team, site, politics):
    # Base calculation
    score = d100_roll
    score += preparation_bonus(0-30)
    score += expertise_matches(team, site)  # Cap +15
    score -= site_friction(location)
    score -= political_friction(factions)

    # Outcome thresholds
    if score < 40:
        return failure_table(preparation_depth)
    elif score < 65:
        return partial_success()
    elif score < 85:
        return solid_success()
    else:
        return landmark_discovery()
```

### Failure as Content

- **Spectacular Failures**: Generate memorable disasters
- **Sideways Discoveries**: Wrong theory, right evidence
- **Preparation Rewards**: Deep prep yields better failures
- **Narrative Hooks**: Every failure creates drama

## Game Flow Architecture

### Daily Rhythm (Real Time â†’ Game Time)

- **1 Real Day = 1 Game Year**
- **Gazette Posts**: 13:00 and 21:00 digests
- **Order Processing**: Asynchronous submission
- **Event Threading**: Actions nest under digests

### Weekly Symposium

- **Forced Public Stance**: Hot topic debate
- **Reputation Stakes**: Can't stay neutral
- **Scholar Reactions**: Public support/opposition
- **Faction Alignment**: Reveals political leanings

### Action Types

1. **Submit Theory**: Public claim with confidence wager
2. **Recruit Scholar**: Influence cost, loyalty check
3. **Launch Expedition**: Resource investment, team selection
4. **Mentor Scholar**: Build loyalty, improve stats
5. **Publish Manifesto**: Public position statement

## Scholar Defection Mechanics

```python
def defection_probability(scholar, offer, player_treatment):
    # Base factors
    temptation = offer.quality
    mistreatment = calculate_mistreatment(scholar, player_treatment)
    alignment = faction_match(scholar.politics, offer.faction)
    plateau = career_stagnation(scholar)

    # Personality modifiers
    loyalty_factor = -0.6 * scholar.stats["loyalty"] / 10
    integrity_factor = -0.4 * scholar.stats["integrity"] / 10

    # Logistic function
    x = temptation + mistreatment + alignment + plateau
    x += loyalty_factor + integrity_factor

    return 1 / (1 + exp(-6 * (x - 0.5)))
```

### Defection Triggers

- **Credit Theft**: Major loyalty hit
- **Authorship Snubs**: Accumulating resentment
- **Better Offers**: Career advancement elsewhere
- **Faction Pressure**: Political realignment
- **Public Humiliation**: Reputation damage

## Press System Design

### Template Categories

- **Academic Bulletin**: Theory submissions
- **Research Manifesto**: Expedition launches
- **Discovery Report**: Success announcements
- **Retraction Notice**: Public failures
- **Academic Gossip**: Scholar commentary
- **Defection Wire**: Loyalty changes

### Narrative Generation Rules

- **Short & Quotable**: Twitter-length drama
- **Consistent Voice**: Per-scholar personality
- **Public Record**: Everything is permanent
- **Meme Potential**: Designed for screenshots

## Influence Economy

### Five Faction Vectors

```python
factions = {
    "Academic": "University support, research grants",
    "Government": "Site access, excavation permits",
    "Industry": "Equipment, logistics, technology",
    "Religious": "Sacred sites, ancient texts",
    "Foreign": "International collaboration, exotic locations"
}
```

### Soft Cap Scaling

- Caps increase with total reputation
- Prevents single-faction dominance
- Forces diplomatic breadth
- Creates strategic trade-offs

## Emergent Narrative Patterns

### Drama Arcs

1. **Betrayal & Revenge**: Zathras steals credit, long grudge
2. **Redemption Arc**: Failed theory leads to breakthrough
3. **Rising Star**: Mentored junior becomes rival
4. **Academic War**: Competing schools of thought
5. **Spectacular Downfall**: Hubris leads to ruin

### Memory & Relationships

- **Permanent Facts**: "Sarah defended me in Y51"
- **Decaying Feelings**: Anger fades but never zeros
- **Scars**: Betrayals create permanent modifiers
- **Network Effects**: Scholars influence each other

## Balance Philosophy

### Anti-Exploit Design

- **No Private Moves**: Everything is public
- **Preparation Gates**: Can't rush expeditions
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevent action spamming
- **Social Consequences**: Scholars remember everything

### Meaningful Choices

- Every confidence level has strategic value
- Multiple paths to reputation
- Different faction strategies viable
- Risk/reward properly calibrated

## Victory Conditions

### Reputation Thresholds

- **-50 to +50 Scale**: Bounded progression
- **Unlock Tiers**: New actions at milestones
- **Social Locks**: Low reputation limits options
- **Comeback Mechanics**: Never fully out

### Campaign End States

- **Time Limit**: Fixed game duration
- **Reputation Victory**: First to threshold
- **Discovery Victory**: Major breakthrough
- **Narrative Victory**: Most memorable story

## Testing Considerations

### Determinism Requirements

- Fixed seeds produce identical scholars
- Expedition outcomes reproducible
- Defection chances verifiable
- Event replay matches exactly

### Balance Validation

- Monte Carlo confidence simulations
- Defection rate curve testing
- Influence economy equilibrium
- Narrative variety sampling

Remember: The domain model creates the stage for academic drama, permanent consequences, and emergent storytelling.
