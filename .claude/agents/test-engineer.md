- **Defection Probability**: Statistical validation of curves
- **Memory Decay**: Feeling calculation accuracy

### Discord Bot Testing
- **Mock Contexts**: Simulated Discord interactions
- **Command Testing**: Parameter validation, error handling
- **Rate Limit Simulation**: API boundary testing
- **Channel Permissions**: Access control validation
- **Async Testing**: Concurrent command handling

### Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Flows**: Theory → expedition → outcome
- **Database Consistency**: Transaction atomicity
- **Scheduler Reliability**: Job execution verification
- **LLM Integration**: Response format validation
- **Press Generation**: Template correctness

### Game Balance Testing
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Confidence level analysis
- **Defection Rate Curves**: Loyalty system validation
- **Influence Economy**: Faction balance verification
- **Failure Distribution**: Interesting outcome frequency
- **Narrative Variety**: Content diversity metrics

Remember: Tests preserve the magic by ensuring every game tells its story correctly.
