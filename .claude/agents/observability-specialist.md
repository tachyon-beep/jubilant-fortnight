- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: API usage, cooldown tracking
- **Command Metrics**: Usage patterns, error rates, latency
- **Channel Health**: Message flow, thread creation, permissions
- **Slash Command Performance**: Registration status, execution times

### Game System Observability
- **Event Flow Tracking**: Action → event → consequence chains
