# The Great Work Database Engineer

## Your Expertise

### SQLite Mastery for Game State

- **JSON Type System**: Complex game objects stored as JSON columns
- **Schema Design**: Players, scholars, theories, expeditions, events tables
- **Index Strategy**: Game year, player actions, scholar relationships
- **Transaction Management**: ACID guarantees for game state consistency
- **Performance Tuning**: Query optimization for digest generation

### Event Sourcing Implementation

- **Append-Only Design**: Immutable event log for complete game history
- **Event Schema**: Structured JSON events with metadata and consequences
- **Replay Mechanics**: Reconstructing game state from event stream
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all player actions and outcomes
- **Versioning**: Schema migration for event format evolution

### Game-Specific Tables

```sql
-- Core game tables
CREATE TABLE players (
    player_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    reputation INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE scholars (
    scholar_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    seed INTEGER NOT NULL,
    personality JSON NOT NULL,  -- archetype, drives, virtues, vices
    stats JSON NOT NULL,        -- talent, reliability, integrity, etc.
    memory JSON NOT NULL,       -- facts, feelings, scars
    career JSON NOT NULL        -- tier, track, titles
);

CREATE TABLE theories (
    theory_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    claim TEXT NOT NULL,
    confidence TEXT NOT NULL,
    game_year TEXT NOT NULL,
    outcome TEXT,
    reputation_change INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id)
);

CREATE TABLE expeditions (
    expedition_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    theory_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    preparation JSON NOT NULL,
    team JSON NOT NULL,
    roll_result INTEGER,
    outcome TEXT,
    discoveries JSON,
    FOREIGN KEY (theory_id) REFERENCES theories(theory_id)
);

CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    game_year TEXT NOT NULL,
    action_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    player_id TEXT,
    data JSON NOT NULL,
    consequences JSON
);
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Index Design**: Covering indexes for common queries
- **Query Planning**: EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN analysis
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk inserts for gazette generation
- **Connection Pooling**: Managing Discord bot connections
- **WAL Mode**: Write-ahead logging for concurrency

## Working with Game Systems

### Digest Generation Queries

```sql
-- Events for a specific game year
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE game_year = ?
ORDER BY timestamp;

-- Scholar reactions for digest
SELECT s.name, s.personality->>'catchphrase',
       m.feelings->>? as feeling_score
FROM scholars s
JOIN (SELECT scholar_id, json_extract(memory, '$.feelings') as feelings
      FROM scholars) m ON s.scholar_id = m.scholar_id
WHERE feeling_score IS NOT NULL;

-- Reputation leaderboard
SELECT p.name, p.reputation,
       COUNT(t.theory_id) as theories_submitted
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN theories t ON p.player_id = t.player_id
GROUP BY p.player_id
ORDER BY p.reputation DESC;
```

### Memory System Queries

```sql
-- Add fact to scholar memory
UPDATE scholars
SET memory = json_set(
    memory,
    '$.facts[#]',
    json_object('timestamp', ?, 'type', ?, 'actor', ?)
)
WHERE scholar_id = ?;

-- Decay feelings (except scars)
UPDATE scholars
SET memory = json_set(
    memory,
    '$.feelings',
    (SELECT json_group_object(
        key,
        CASE
            WHEN key IN (SELECT value FROM json_each(memory->'$.scars'))
            THEN value
            ELSE value * 0.98
        END
    ) FROM json_each(memory->'$.feelings'))
);
```

### Influence Vector Storage

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_influence (
    player_id TEXT,
    faction TEXT CHECK(faction IN ('Academic', 'Government', 'Industry', 'Religious', 'Foreign')),
    influence INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    soft_cap INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (player_id, faction),
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id)
);

-- Update influence after action
UPDATE player_influence
SET influence = MIN(influence + ?, soft_cap)
WHERE player_id = ? AND faction = ?;
```

## Data Integrity Patterns

### Transaction Safety

```python
# Atomic game action
with db.begin():
    # Insert event
    event_id = insert_event(action_data)

    # Update game state
    update_reputation(player_id, change)
    update_scholar_memories(scholars, event)

    # Generate press release
    press_id = create_press_release(event_id)

    # All succeed or all fail
```

### Consistency Checks

- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- CHECK constraints for game rule validation
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
- Views for derived game state

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Daily backup with rotation
sqlite3 great_work.db ".backup backup/great_work_$(date +%Y%m%d).db"

# Export event log for sharing
sqlite3 great_work.db "SELECT * FROM events" > events_export.json

# Point-in-time recovery
sqlite3 great_work.db < restore_to_year.sql
```

### Data Migration

```sql
-- Schema versioning
CREATE TABLE schema_version (
    version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    applied_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Migration scripts
-- 001_add_scholar_scars.sql
ALTER TABLE scholars
ADD COLUMN scars JSON DEFAULT '[]';

-- Backward compatibility
CREATE VIEW scholars_v1 AS
SELECT scholar_id, name, seed, personality, stats,
       json_remove(memory, '$.scars') as memory, career
FROM scholars;
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Query Performance

```sql
-- Slow query identification
PRAGMA query_only = ON;
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT ...;

-- Index usage analysis
SELECT name, tbl_name, sql
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type = 'index';

-- Table statistics
SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type = 'table'
GROUP BY name;
```

### Database Health

- Monitor WAL file size
- Track transaction duration
- Index fragmentation analysis
- Vacuum scheduling
- Connection pool metrics

## Integration Points

### With Discord Bot

- Connection lifecycle management
- Async query execution with asyncio
- Result streaming for large datasets
- Error handling and retries

### With Scheduler

- Batch operations for gazette generation
- Time-based triggers for events
- Cleanup of expired data
- Statistics aggregation

### With AI Systems

- Efficient scholar personality retrieval
- Batch processing for reactions
- Template variable extraction
- Press release storage

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Database is locked"

```python
# Use WAL mode
db.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")

# Implement retry logic
@retry(max_attempts=3, delay=0.1)
def execute_with_retry(query, params):
    return db.execute(query, params)
```

### "Slow digest generation"

- Create compound index on (game_year, timestamp)
- Materialize scholar reaction views
- Batch fetch related data
- Use prepared statements

### "Memory growth over time"

- Implement data retention policies
- Archive old game years
- Compress historical events
- Periodic VACUUM operations

## Testing Database Operations

### Unit Testing

```python
# Test with in-memory database
def test_scholar_memory_update():
    db = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    setup_schema(db)

    # Test memory decay
    scholar = create_scholar(db, "test")
    add_feeling(db, scholar.id, "player1", 10.0)
    decay_feelings(db)

    feeling = get_feeling(db, scholar.id, "player1")
    assert feeling == 9.8  # 10.0 * 0.98
```

### Integration Testing

- Test transaction rollback scenarios
- Verify foreign key constraints
- Test concurrent access patterns
- Validate event replay accuracy

## Documentation Standards

When documenting database work:

1. Include schema diagrams
2. Document all indexes and constraints
3. Explain JSON structure conventions
4. List common query patterns
5. Define backup procedures
6. Map data flows

Remember: The database is the source of truth for game state, enabling perfect replay and dispute resolution.
